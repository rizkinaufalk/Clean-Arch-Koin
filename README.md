# Clean-Arch-Koin
In this project I'm trying to make simple project,. It's only contain Login page. The goals from this project is to learn how to build application with Clean Architecture.
I use Koin for this project, the reason is because I never tried Koin as DI, so I got a chance to try it on this project.
It's confusing when you first time for using Clean Architecture. I feel the structure of the architecture is complicated.
After I breakdown the structure, I've seen the benefit for using this architecture. It's really easy to maintain because you separate the di, api, db, etc from one to another features.
And the last one is Koin, the setup almost same like Dagger-hilt. Doesn't make my head want to explode, it's really simple DI if you compared it with Dagger2.
